# rust-mine-sweep

This is a simple project that I'm using as a learning experience with Rust programming, as well as the specific `egui`/`eframe` crate.

The end goal is to produce something like _Mine Sweeper_. For ease of access (/ me not wanting to deal with different crates in a single project),
I'm just going to keep all of the code in src/main.rs; of course with extensive documentation.

Check main.rs or the auto-generated docs, comments are good for me and you're viewing/understanding pleasure.
