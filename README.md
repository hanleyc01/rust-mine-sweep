# rust-mine-sweep

This is a simple project that I'm using as a learning experience with Rust programming, as well as the specific `egui`/`eframe` crate.

The end goal is to produce something like _Mine Sweeper_. Check the respective crates for more info; note `board.rs` for the "game-engine".

Check main.rs or the auto-generated docs, comments are good for me and you're viewing/understanding pleasure.
